BHCgeo

The Climatic Water Balance (CWB or BHC in portuguese) of Thornthwaite and Mather (1955)
is a soil water monitoring method that considers the soil as an active ingredient in its calculation
as a reservoir that hinders the exit of water as it dries. 
In periods where the total Precipitation (P) is less than the Potential Evapotranspiration (PET),
the retained water becomes a function of this potential demand (P-PET < 0) 
and of the Available Water Capacity (AWC) used in the calculations. 
If there is a sequence of periods in this condition, the water retained in the soil
will be a sequential function of the accumulated negative values of P - PET, that is, 
the accumulated potential loss. Therefore, this Plugin needs as input, 12 rasters of P, 
12 rasters of ETP and one raster of the AWC, 
being these 12 rasters one raster for each month of the year.
